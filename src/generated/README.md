# Generated Types Directory

This directory contains auto-generated TypeScript types from OpenAPI specifications.

## ⚠️ DO NOT EDIT FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY

All files in this directory are automatically generated by the `npm run generate` command.
Any manual changes will be overwritten on the next generation run.

## Regenerating Types

To regenerate types from OpenAPI specs:

```bash
npm run generate
```

To regenerate types automatically when specs change (watch mode):

```bash
npm run generate:watch
```

## Source of Truth

The source of truth for these types are the OpenAPI specification files in `openapi/spec/`.

To modify types, edit the OpenAPI specs and regenerate:

1. Edit `openapi/spec/*.yaml`
2. Run `npm run generate`
3. Verify types with `npm run typecheck`

## Generated Files

- `*.ts` - Type definitions from each OpenAPI spec
- `index.ts` - Unified exports with namespace organization
